# Model Selection Platform

**Copyright Â© 2024 Yuxuan Zhou. All rights reserved.**

A fullstack application for model selection and download functionality. This MVP focuses on making one model work first and then expanding to support multiple models in future versions.

## Project Overview

### MVP_28 - External Model Integration Platform
This project implements a platform that integrates external AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) to provide users with access to various AI services. The focus is on:

- **External Model Integration**: Connect to third-party AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- **Download Client**: Implement a download system for AI models, starting with one model and expanding to others
- **Model Selection Interface**: Beautiful UI for users to choose and interact with different AI models
- **Unified Platform**: Single interface to access multiple external AI services

### MVP_29 - MornGPT Self-Models (Future)
The next iteration will implement and try to optimize it to be more fast and later implement MornGPT's own AI models from A-Z, providing:
- **Custom AI Models**: MornGPT's proprietary AI models
- **Specialized Domains**: Models for specific use cases (Growth Advisory, AI Coder, Medical Advice, etc.)
- **Complete Control**: Full ownership and control over the AI models

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose from available AI models (external models in MVP_28)
- **External Model Downloads**: Download models for local use
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful and intuitive user interface
- **Fullstack Architecture**: Frontend and backend integration
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive chat interface with AI models
- **File Upload Support**: Upload documents and images for AI analysis
- **Voice & Video Input**: Pro features for voice and video interactions
- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI models for complex tasks

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (for MVP)
- **Model Management**: Local file system storage
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI APIs

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Backend .env
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Add your API keys for external models
   ```

3. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start backend (from backend directory)
   npm run dev
   
   # Start frontend (from frontend directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
