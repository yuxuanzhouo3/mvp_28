   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuxuanzhouo3/mvp_28.git
   cd mvp_28
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Backend environment variables
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-api-key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key
   ```

4. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Start backend (from backend directory)
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Start frontend (from frontend directory)
   cd frontend
   PORT=3002 npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open http://localhost:3002** in your browser

### Production Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to Vercel with all environment variables configured.
