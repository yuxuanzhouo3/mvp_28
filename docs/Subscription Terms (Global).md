## 2. Subscription Calculation Rules

### 2.1 Same-tier Renewal (Extending the same plan)

When you renew the same subscription plan, the system automatically extends your expiration date:

- **Monthly Renewal**: Extends by 1 calendar month from current expiration date
- **Annual Renewal**: Extends by 12 calendar months from current expiration date
- **Month-end Stickiness Rule**: If your billing date is the 31st, the system handles month differences intelligently
  - Example: Jan 31 monthly renewal → expires Feb 28 (or 29)
  - March renewal → expiration auto-adjusts back to Mar 31
  - We guarantee your billing date won't permanently shift earlier due to month-length differences

### 2.2 Upgrading Subscription (Lower to Higher tier)

When upgrading from a lower-tier to a higher-tier plan:

1. **Calculate Remaining Value**: The system calculates remaining days of your current plan and prorates the value
   - Remaining Value = Remaining Days × (Current Plan Monthly Price ÷ 30)
2. **Value Conversion**: Remaining value is converted to days on the new plan
   - Converted Days = Remaining Value ÷ (New Plan Monthly Price ÷ 30)
3. **New Expiration Calculation**: New plan expires = Today + Converted Days + Purchased Period Days
4. **Effective Time**: Upgrade takes effect immediately
5. **Quota Handling**:
   - You immediately receive the new plan's monthly quota limits
   - Addon pack credits remain unaffected

### 2.3 Downgrading Subscription (Higher to Lower tier)

When downgrading from a higher-tier to a lower-tier plan:

1. **Delayed Effect**: Downgrade does NOT take effect immediately; it activates the day after your current plan expires
2. **Continue Enjoying**: You continue enjoying all higher-tier benefits until current plan expiration
3. **Quota Reset**: When downgrade activates, monthly quota resets to the new plan's limits
4. **Pending Status**: The system records your downgrade intent and auto-executes upon expiration

## 3. Quota Refresh Mechanism

### 3.1 Daily External Model Calls

- **Refresh Time**: Automatically refreshes daily at 00:00 Beijing Time (UTC+8)
- **Refresh Rule**: Daily used count resets to 0
- **Applies To**: All external model calls (excludes the unlimited General Model)

### 3.2 Monthly Multimodal Quota (Image/Video/Audio)

- **Refresh Time**: Refreshes on your personal billing anchor day (the date of your first subscription)
- **Month-end Stickiness**: If your billing date is the 31st, the system handles it intelligently
  - February billing date auto-adjusts to 28/29
  - March billing date auto-adjusts back to 31
- **Refresh Rule**: Monthly quota resets to your current plan's quota limits

## 4. Quota Gas Packs (Additional Credits)

| Tier | Price | Image Credits | Video/Audio Credits | Validity |
|:---:|:-----:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|
| Starter | $3.98 | 30 | 5 | Permanent |
| Standard | $9.98 | 100 | 20 | Permanent |
| Premium | $29.98 | 300 | 60 | Permanent |

**Deduction Policy**: FEFO (First Expiring, First Out)

To maximize your benefits, the system strictly follows the "consume expiring credits first" principle:

1. **First Priority: Monthly Subscription Quota** 🟢
   - System prioritizes deducting from your plan's monthly quota
   - Monthly quota is valid only for the current period and cannot carry over
   - Unused monthly quota resets on your billing date

2. **Second Priority: Addon Pack Credits** 🔵
   - Only when monthly quota is exhausted (or you have no active subscription) will addon credits be used
   - Addon pack credits are permanent and never expire

**Addon Pack Special Rules**:
- **Permanent Validity**: Unused credits remain in your account indefinitely
- **Independent Usage**: Even if your subscription expires or is cancelled, you can still use addon credits
- **Stacking Rule**: Multiple addon pack purchases accumulate directly
- **Non-refundable**: Addon packs are digital products and cannot be refunded once purchased

## 5. Changes & Renewal

### 5.1 Upgrade

- Upgrade takes effect immediately
- Billing date reset: The upgrade day becomes your new billing date
- Quota handling: You immediately receive the new plan's full monthly quota; unused quota from the old plan is overwritten (addon pack credits remain unaffected)

### 5.2 Renewal

- After successful renewal, your billing date remains unchanged
- Monthly quota automatically resets to full on your billing date

### 5.3 Expiration/Cancellation

- After subscription expires, unused monthly quota becomes invalid and resets to zero
- Addon pack credits in your account remain available for continued use

---

## 6. Exceptions & Limitations

### 6.1 Payment Failure
If automatic renewal fails, the system will suspend your subscription benefits (monthly quota resets to zero) until payment succeeds. You can still use addon pack credits during this period.

### 6.2 Compliance Checks
The system performs IP-based compliance checks. Access may be restricted if anomalous regions are detected (e.g., certain restricted areas).
